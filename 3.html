                    <h2>Pollution</h2>
                    <p>Pollution in marine environments, including plastic debris and chemical contaminants, threatens marine life and ecosystems. Effective solutions involve reducing plastic consumption, improving waste management, and implementing stricter regulations to minimize chemical and nutrient pollution in coastal and oceanic waters.</p>

                    <h2>Overfishing</h2>
                    <p>Overfishing in marine environments depletes fish stocks and disrupts marine food webs, leading to ecosystem imbalances and threats to biodiversity. Sustainable fishing practices and effective fisheries management are crucial to ensure the long-term health and productivity of marine ecosystems.</p>

                    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
                    <p>Climate change impacts marine environments through ocean acidification, warming waters, and sea level rise, which threaten marine ecosystems and biodiversity. Mitigating these impacts requires global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable marine habitats.</p>
